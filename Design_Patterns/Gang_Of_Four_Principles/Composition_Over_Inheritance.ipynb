Based on the design of logging modules in other languages — see PEP 282’s “Influences” section for the main inspirations — the Python logging module implements its own Composition Over Inheritance pattern.\n",

    "1. The `Logger` class that callers interact with doesn’t itself implement either filtering or output. Instead, it maintains a list of filters and a list of handlers.\n",
    "2. For each log message, the logger calls each of its filters. The message is discarded if any filter rejects it.\n",
    "3. For each log message that’s accepted by all the filters, the logger loops over its output handlers and asks every one of them to `emit()` the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, at least, that’s the core of the idea. The Standard Library’s logging is in fact more complicated. For example, each handler can carry its own list of filters in addition to those listed by its logger. And each handler also specifies a minimum message “level” like `INFO` or `WARN` that, rather confusingly, is enforced neither by the handler itself nor by any of the handler’s filters, but instead by an `if` statement buried deep inside the logger where it loops over the handlers. The total design is thus a bit of a mess.\n",

The parameter list might look verbose but, thanks to Python’s optional keyword arguments, most calls to the class won’t need to provide all four arguments.\n",

But let’s balance that temptation by making explicit what’s been lost by dodging Composition Over Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Locality** - Reorganizing the code to use if statements hasn’t been an unmitigated win for readability. If you are tasked with improving or debugging one particular feature — say, the support for writing to a socket — you will find that you can’t read its code all in one place. The code behind that single feature is scattered between the initializer’s parameter list, the initializer’s code, and the log() method itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletability** - An underappreciated property of good design is that it makes deleting features easy. Perhaps only veterans of large and mature Python applications will strongly enough appreciate the importance of code deletion to a project’s health. In the case of our class-based solutions, we can trivially delete a feature like logging to a socket by removing the SocketHandler class and its unit tests once the application no longer needs it. By contrast, deleting the socket feature from the forest of if statements not only requires caution to avoid breaking adjacent code, but raises the awkward question of what to do with the socket parameter in the initializer. Can it be removed? Not if we need to keep the list of positional parameters consistent — we would need to retain the parameter, but raise an exception if it’s ever used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dead code analysis** - Related to the previous point is the fact that when we use Composition Over Inheritance, dead code analyzers can trivially detect when the last use of SocketHandler in the codebase disappears. But dead code analysis is often helpless to make a determination like “you can now remove all the attributes and if statements related to socket output, because no surviving call to the initializer passes anything for socket other than None.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing** - One of the strongest signals about code health that our tests provide is how many lines of irrelevant code have to run before reaching the line under test. Testing a feature like logging to a socket is easy if the test can simply spin up a SocketHandler instance, pass it a live socket, and ask it to emit() a message. No code runs except code relevant to the feature. But testing socket logging in our forest of if statements will run at least three times the number of lines of code. Having to set up a logger with the right combination of several features merely to test one of them is an important warning sign, that might seem trivial in this small example but becomes crucial as a system grows larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Efficiency** - I’m deliberately putting this point last, because readability and maintainability are generally more important concerns. But the design problems with the forest of if statements are also signalled by the approach’s inefficiency. Even if you want a simple unfiltered log to a single file, every single message will be forced to run an if statement against every possible feature you could have enabled. The technique of composition, by contrast, only runs code for the features you’ve composed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of these reasons, I suggest that the apparent simplicity of the if statement forest is, from the point of view of software design, largely an illusion. The ability to read the logger top-to-bottom as a single piece of code comes at the cost of several other kinds of conceptual expense that will grow sharply with the size of the codebase."

    "\n",
    "+ The filter never tries to produce output on its own but, if a message survives filtering, defers the task of output to other code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These close similarities with our earlier Decorator solution mean that we can compare it with this new code to make an unusually sharp comparison between Composition Over Inheritance and multiple inheritance. Let’s sharpen the focus still further with a question:\n",
    "\n",
    "*If we have thorough unit tests for both the logger and filter, how confident are we that they will work together?*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The success of the Decorator example depends only on the public behaviors of each class: that the `LogFilter` offers a `log()` method that in turn calls `log()` on the object it wraps (which a test can trivially verify using a tiny fake logger), and that each logger offers a working `log()` method. As long as our unit tests verify these two public behaviors, we can’t break composition without failing our unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance, by contrast, depends on behavior that cannot be verified by simply instantiating the classes in question. The public behavior of a `FilteredLogger` is that it offers a `log()` method that both filters and writes to a file. But multiple inheritance doesn’t merely depend on that public behavior, but on how that behavior is implemented internally. Multiple inheritance will work if the method is deferring to its base class using `super()`, but not if the method does its own`write()` to the file, even though either implementation would satisfy the unit test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A test suite must therefore go beyond unit testing and perform actual multiple inheritance on the class — or else monkey patch to verify that `log()` calls `super().log()` — to guarantee that multiple inheritance keeps working as future developers work on the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple inheritance has introduced a new `__init__()` method because neither base class’s `__init__()` method accepts enough arguments for a combined filter and logger. That new code needs to be tested, so at least one test will be necessary for every new subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be tempted to concoct a scheme to avoid a new `__init__()` for every subclass, like accepting *args and then passing them on to `super().__init__()`. (If you do pursue that approach, review the classic essay “Python’s Super Considered Harmful” which argues that only ***kw is in fact safe.) The problem with such a scheme is that it hurts readability — you can no longer figure out what arguments an `__init__()` method takes simply by reading its parameter list. And type checking tools will no longer be able to guarantee correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "But whether you give each derived class its own `__init__()` or design them to chain together, your unit tests of the original `FilteredLogger` and `SocketLogger` can’t by themselves guarantee that the classes initialize correctly when combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the Decorator’s design leaves its initializers happily and strictly orthogonal. The filter accepts its `pattern`, the logger accepts its `sock`, and there is no possible conflict between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, it’s possible that two classes work fine on their own, but have class or instance attributes with the same name that will collide when the classes are combined through multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, our small examples here make the chance of collision look too small to worry about — but remember that these examples are merely standing in for the vastly more complicated classes you might write in real applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the programmer writes tests to guard against collision by running `dir()` on instances of each class and checking for attributes they have in common, or by writing an integration test for every possible subclass, the original unit tests of the two separate classes will once again have failed to guarantee that they can combine cleanly through multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any of these reasons, the unit tests of two base classes can stay green even as their ability to be combined through multiple inheritance is broken. This means that the Gang of Four’s “explosion of subclasses to support every combination” will also afflict your tests. Only by testing every combination of m×n base classes in your application can you make it safe for the application to use such classes at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to breaking the guarantees of unit testing, multiple inheritance involves at least three further liabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Introspection is simple in the Decorator case. Simply `print(my_filter.logger)` or view that attribute in a debugger to see what sort of output logger is attached. In the case of multiple inheritance, however, you can only learn which filter and logger have been combined by examining the metadata of the class itself — either by reading its `__mro__` or subjecting the object to a series of `isinstance()` tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It’s trivial in the Decorator case to take a live combination of a filter and logger and at runtime to swap in a different logger through assignment to the `.logger` attribute — say, because the user has just toggled a preference in the application’s interface. But to do the same in the multiple inheritance case would require the rather more objectionable maneuver of overwriting the object’s class. While changing an object’s class at runtime is not impossible in a dynamic language like Python, it’s generally considered a symptom that software design has gone wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, multiple inheritance provides no built-in mechanism to help the programmer order the base classes correctly. The `FilteredSocketLogger` won’t successfully write to a socket if its base classes are swapped and, as dozens of Stack Overflow questions attest, Python programmers have perpetual difficultly with putting third-party base classes in the right order. The Decorator pattern, by contrast, makes it obvious which way the classes compose: the filter’s `__init__()` wants a `logger` object, but the logger’s `__init__()` doesn’t ask for a `filter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance, then, incurs a number of liabilities without adding a single advantage. At least in this example, solving a design problem with inheritance is strictly worse than a design based on composition."

    "The tuple of classes passed to `type()` has the same meaning as the series of base classes in a `class` statement. The `type()` call above creates a new class through multiple inheritance from both a filtered logger and an output logger.\n",

    "Before you ask: yes, it would also work to build a `class` statement as plain text and then pass it to `eval()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But building classes on-the-fly carries severe liabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Readability suffers. A human reading the above snippet of code will have to do extra work to determine what sort of object an instance of `cls` is. Also, many Python programmers aren’t familiar with `type()` and will need to stop and puzzle over its documentation. If they have difficulty with the novel concept that classes can be defined dynamically, they might still be confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If a constructed class like `PatternFilteredFileLog` is named in an exception or error message, the developer will probably be unhappy to discover that nothing comes up when they search the code for that class name. Debugging becomes more difficult when you cannot even locate a class. Considerable time may be spent searching the codebase for `type()` calls and trying to determine which one generated the class. Sometimes developers have to resort to calling each method with bad arguments and using the line numbers in the resulting tracebacks to track down the base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Type introspection will, in the general case, fail for classes constructed dynamically at runtime. “Jump to class” shortcuts in your editor won’t have anywhere to take you when you highlight an instance of `PatternFilteredFileLog` in the debugger. And type checking engines like mypy and pyre-check will be unlikely to offer the strong protections for your generated class that they’re able to provide for normal Python classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The beautiful Jupyter Notebook feature `%autoreload` possesses a nearly preternatural ability to detect and reload modified source code in a live Python interpreter. But it’s foiled, for example, by the multiple inheritance classes that matplotlib builds at runtime through `type()` calls inside its `subplot_class_factory()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once its liabilities are weighed, the attempt to use runtime class generation as a last-ditch maneuver to rescue the already faulty mechanism of multiple inheritance stands as a reductio ad absurdum of the entire project of dodging Composition Over Inheritance when you need an object’s behavior to vary over several independent axes."
