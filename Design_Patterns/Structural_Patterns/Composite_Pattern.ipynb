In Python, the Composite Pattern can often be implemented with less fuss than in tightly constrained object oriented languages. You won’t be forced to inherit your container objects and the objects inside of them from a common parent class. Instead, you can build classes that share only a common interface rather than any implementation — or that are simply duck typed to offer common behavior.</div>"

    "Here, `ls` has transparently detected that four of the names matched by the wildcard `/etc/l*` are files but that `/etc/log` is a directory with more files inside. (Well, with one file inside.) Had UNIX supplied separate commands for listing a file and listing a directory, this wildcard could not safely have been an argument to either command.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, at the level of a command line interface, is the Composite Pattern. Operations like `ls` and `du` and `chmod` that make sense on both files and directories are implemented so that they run transparently on both. This not only lowers cognitive overhead, but makes shell scripts easier to write — there are many operations that a script can simply run blindly without needing to stop and check first whether a path names a file or a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The art of using the Composite Pattern is determining where to break the symmetry. For example, the UNIX filesystem provides completely different commands `touch` for creating a new file and `mkdir` for creating a new directory. This could instead have been a single command with an option that flipped it from file-creating mode to directory-creating mode. But the designers thought that the two operations were conceptually different enough to deserve separate commands. The decision of how much symmetry to create will weigh upon each operation that a designer implements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forcing symmetry where there is really a difference can create awkward special cases. For example, two of the three permission bits in UNIX apply equally to directories and files: `r` gives read permission and `w` gives write permission. But the symmetry breaks at `x`, the third bit, which gives permission to “execute” a file but to “search” a directory by using it in a path. Should there have been two different `chmod` commands, one for files and one for directories? Or should the single `chmod` binary at least have used a different letter for that third bit, maybe `x` when applied to a file but `s` for “search” when applied to a directory? I myself think the designers of UNIX made the right decision here, because I find it easier to remember that `x` means something a little different for a directory than to remember a separate letter for directories, or a separate command. But the decision could have gone either way, and making decisions like these are where the designer applying the Composite Pattern needs finesse.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the symmetries that exist between files and directories on the command line are not exactly the same symmetries that exist down beneath `ls` and `chmod` at the level of system calls. At each level, the Composite Pattern was applied a bit differently. For system calls, some symmetry does exist: `stat()` and `chmod()` and `chown()` operate happily on both files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "But `ls` is hiding the fact that if `stat()` reveals that a path names a directory, then `ls` needs to switch to a directory-specific system call to list the files inside. There is no symmetry between the UNIX system call for reading a normal file’s content and the call for reading the list of files in a directory, and for a crucial reason: the two operations return different types of data. A file contains an unstructured stream of bytes; a directory, a series of distinct filenames. The question of return type will serve as a very important guardrail when you are designing in Python: if your desire to create symmetry between container and content leads you to engineer calls that require an `if` statement or `isinstance()` to safely handle their return value, then the desire for symmetry has led you astray."

    "## On hierarchies\n",
    "As we now turn our attention to how the Composite Pattern looks in a programming language like Python, we should ponder a question that hangs above so much of the object-oriented and design-pattern literature from the 1990s:\n",
    "\n",
    "Where have all the hierarchies gone?\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction and manipulation of extensive hierarchies was both a frequent exercise for new programmers and a tedious labor for more experienced programmers. Hours were spent deciding how hierarchies would be constructed, what operations they would support, and how their destructors could be safely invoked. Hierarchies were everywhere.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ Popular languages in the late 1990s went wild for deeply nested package namespaces. To take a modern example from Go, the package `google.golang.org/appengine`, one must admit, comes with a hard guarantee that it won’t conflict with the name of a package from another firm. The Zope 3 project, in its heyday, happily festooned the Python Package Index with multi-level package names like `zope.app.form` and `zope.app.i18n`. But today most Python packages opt for a simple non-compound name that jostles alongside the names of all other Python packages. And it almost never causes problems.\n",

    "2. The programming curricula of yore were rife with binary search trees, B+ trees, and tree balancing algorithms. But in real code, trees are very scarce. For every programmer who works on trees to, say, to write a persistent storage engine like BoltDB or Redis, a thousand programmers get to skip the exercise. Python programmers don’t tend to use binary search trees; we use the even faster hash table (the Python “dictionary”) whose structure, as it happens, is entirely flat — not a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There was an era when hierarchy was inherent in the structure of databases. An employee record might hold a salary history right inside of it. But while hierarchy continues to exist around the edges of data storage, most recently in the form of NoSQL and document databases, our workhorse data stores tend to be flat ones: the relational database, the CSV file, the Pandas dataframe."

Instead, when we can, we parse them from a native representation that makes the hierarchy explicit and natural.

The more restrictive option would be to avoid putting `winfo_children()` on all widgets and instead only making truly general operations like `winfo_rootx()` universal (general, because all widgets have an x-coordinate). I myself tend to enjoy interfaces more when there is as much symmetry as possible.\n",
