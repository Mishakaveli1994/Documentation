Based on the design of logging modules in other languages — see PEP 282’s “Influences” section for the main inspirations — the Python logging module implements its own Composition Over Inheritance pattern.\n",

    "1. The `Logger` class that callers interact with doesn’t itself implement either filtering or output. Instead, it maintains a list of filters and a list of handlers.\n",
    "2. For each log message, the logger calls each of its filters. The message is discarded if any filter rejects it.\n",
    "3. For each log message that’s accepted by all the filters, the logger loops over its output handlers and asks every one of them to `emit()` the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, at least, that’s the core of the idea. The Standard Library’s logging is in fact more complicated. For example, each handler can carry its own list of filters in addition to those listed by its logger. And each handler also specifies a minimum message “level” like `INFO` or `WARN` that, rather confusingly, is enforced neither by the handler itself nor by any of the handler’s filters, but instead by an `if` statement buried deep inside the logger where it loops over the handlers. The total design is thus a bit of a mess.\n",

    "The if statement approach is not entirely without benefit. This class’s whole range of possible behaviors can be grasped in a single reading of the code from top to bottom. The parameter list might look verbose but, thanks to Python’s optional keyword arguments, most calls to the class won’t need to provide all four arguments.\n",

But let’s balance that temptation by making explicit what’s been lost by dodging Composition Over Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Locality** - Reorganizing the code to use if statements hasn’t been an unmitigated win for readability. If you are tasked with improving or debugging one particular feature — say, the support for writing to a socket — you will find that you can’t read its code all in one place. The code behind that single feature is scattered between the initializer’s parameter list, the initializer’s code, and the log() method itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletability** - An underappreciated property of good design is that it makes deleting features easy. Perhaps only veterans of large and mature Python applications will strongly enough appreciate the importance of code deletion to a project’s health. In the case of our class-based solutions, we can trivially delete a feature like logging to a socket by removing the SocketHandler class and its unit tests once the application no longer needs it. By contrast, deleting the socket feature from the forest of if statements not only requires caution to avoid breaking adjacent code, but raises the awkward question of what to do with the socket parameter in the initializer. Can it be removed? Not if we need to keep the list of positional parameters consistent — we would need to retain the parameter, but raise an exception if it’s ever used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dead code analysis** - Related to the previous point is the fact that when we use Composition Over Inheritance, dead code analyzers can trivially detect when the last use of SocketHandler in the codebase disappears. But dead code analysis is often helpless to make a determination like “you can now remove all the attributes and if statements related to socket output, because no surviving call to the initializer passes anything for socket other than None.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing** - One of the strongest signals about code health that our tests provide is how many lines of irrelevant code have to run before reaching the line under test. Testing a feature like logging to a socket is easy if the test can simply spin up a SocketHandler instance, pass it a live socket, and ask it to emit() a message. No code runs except code relevant to the feature. But testing socket logging in our forest of if statements will run at least three times the number of lines of code. Having to set up a logger with the right combination of several features merely to test one of them is an important warning sign, that might seem trivial in this small example but becomes crucial as a system grows larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Efficiency** - I’m deliberately putting this point last, because readability and maintainability are generally more important concerns. But the design problems with the forest of if statements are also signalled by the approach’s inefficiency. Even if you want a simple unfiltered log to a single file, every single message will be forced to run an if statement against every possible feature you could have enabled. The technique of composition, by contrast, only runs code for the features you’ve composed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all of these reasons, I suggest that the apparent simplicity of the if statement forest is, from the point of view of software design, largely an illusion. The ability to read the logger top-to-bottom as a single piece of code comes at the cost of several other kinds of conceptual expense that will grow sharply with the size of the codebase."
